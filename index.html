          <h3>CONTROLLING THE BOARD LED</h3>
          <div class="row">
          <p>I downloaded and compiled the code provided in blink_LED.ino. I then installed the Arduido onto the breadboard and connected the USB cable to supply power to the hardware.
             After verifying that the Arduino has responded to the code as expected, I played around with sections of the code (such as the values of the delay statements) to get a sense of how programming the Arduino will work in the future.</p>

          <h3>CdS PHOTOSENSORS</h3>
          <div class="row">
          <p>For the robot to be able to able to “see” the light in future labs, it must be able to use the light incident upon the photoresitors and assess its actions. 
            From the CsD spec sheet we can see that as the amount of light increases, the resistance of the two devices decreases. In dark spaces, the resistance is 
            approximately 70-80 kOhms, while in bright environments it decreases down to 8-10 kOhms. </p>

            <p>The variable resistance of the photoresitors is required for the robot to determine what to do next, however, the information about the amount of light exposure 
              must be translated into an electrical signal for the Arduino to be able to process it. 
            In order to do this, I built a simple voltage divider circuit with a photoresistor, a 10kOhm pull-down resistor, and Vout which would be connected to an analog input pin on the Arduino. 
            Given a 10kOhm pull-down resistor, Vout would be approximately 0.6 V under little illumination and 2.7 V under a lot of illumination. 
            The completed circuit can be seen in the photo below. </p>

            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/L1_edit.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="551" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>
            </p>
            
            <p>Vout of the circuit is connected to A0, and this input voltage to the Arduino can now be converted to a value somewhere between 0 and 1023, 
            reflecting the brightness of the light falling upon the photoresistors relative to Vref (which using the code provided in CdS_ReadA0.ino was determined to be 5V).
            Knowing Vref and the approximate input voltages under bright and dark conditions, the results of analogRead can now be estimated. 
            In a dark environment, the result of analogRead should be around 120, and in a bright environment it should be around 550.
            Actually performing the experiment, under “normal“ conditions the output of A0 from the Serial Monitor is around 200. 
            Under “bright” conditions (CdS photoresistor illuminated by a flashlight), the reading is about 885-915. Since the robot will have two eyes, 
            two photoresistor circuits must be built - one for the right side and the other for the left side. One sensor’s circuit output is connected to A0, 
            and the other sensor’s output is sent to A1. The completed photoresistor circuit can be seen below. </p>
             
            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/L2_edit.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="600" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>
            </p>

          <h3>CODING TO CONTROL THE ROBOT</h3>
          <div class="row">
          <p>In order for the robot to move as desired later, it must be able to determine when a bright light hits one of its eyes. A good way to do so is to calculate a 
            normalized measurement NM for each eye — a value between 0 and 1 which tells the Arduino whether or not one eye is being exposed to  significantly more light 
            than the other. For example, NMleft = 0.25 would mean that the right sensor is getting a higher light reading than the left sensor, and NMleft = 0.75 would mean 
            that the left sensor is getting a higher reading than the right sensor. NMleft close to 0.5 would mean that both sensors are getting roughly equal readings. </p>


          <p>To be able to read both A0 and A1, I created a new file CdS_ReadA0A1.ino which follows the format of CdS_ReadA0.ino, except that now both pins must be set up 
            and read simultaneously. In the same file, float variables NMleft and NMright are calculated. To make sure that the normalized measurements are being calculated 
            correctly, code that displays the values of NMleft and NMright on the Serial Monitor every 1000ms was also written. As I moved the flashlight from one side of 
            the robot to the other, NMleft and NMright changed accordingly — reflecting the lighting conditions for each photoresistor. </p>

          <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
          <p>Overall, Lab 1 went smoothly with only a few challenges along the way. While writing the code for calculating NMleft and NMright, I ran into the issue of the 
            Serial Monitor outputting 0 for both readings. However, I realized that I was incorrectly casting integers to float variables and later was able to resolve the issue. </p>

        <h3>UNDERSTANDING THE ADC</h3>
          <div class="row">
          <p>The analog-to-digital conversion process within the Arduino is timed with a CLK_ADC signal which is generated from the 
            CPU clock (CLK_PER). To generate the CLK_ADC signal, the microcontroller uses CLK_PER and divides it down by a factor called 
            the prescaler which is specified by the CTRLC register of ADC0. The value of the prescaler can be specified manually, however 
            it also has a default value. To determine the default value of the prescaler, I wrote a simple sketch that read the appropriate
            values of CTRLC register. The serial monitor output 2:0 = 110 which corresponded to 0X6 meaning that the default value of the 
            rescaler for CLK_PER is 128.</p>

          <P>I then modified the code to also read the appropriate bits of the MCLKCTRLB register of CLKCTRL to determine the prescaler used by 
            the Nano that fixes the value of CLK_PER. The serial monitor output 4:1 = 0000 which corresponds to a division value of 2, however, 
            since the PEN bit was set to 0 CLK_MAIN wasn't actually being scaled.</P>

          <p>Knowing the prescaler values for both CLK_ADC and CLK_PER we can now calculate the frequency and period of CLK_ADC. Additionally, 
            given that the ADC requires an input clock frequency between 50 kHz and 1.5 MHz for maximum resolution, we can calculate the 
            minimum allowable ADC prescaler that must be used for the CLK_PER signal corresponding to the 16 MHz signal of the
            oscillator to be 16. This is equilvalent to CLK_ADC frequency of 1MHz.</p>

          <p>To get an idea of how fast the ADC can be operated in reality, I then tested various ADC prescaler values with the +3.3V pin 
            acting as the input. Using the provided file ADC_SingleConvClass.ino, I read the output of the analog‐to‐digital
            conversion of the +3.3V pin first for 16 as the prescaler, and then for the rest of the possible values.</p>

          <h3>CONNECTING AND TESTING H-BRIDGE</h3>
            <div class="row">
            <p>For the robot to function as desired, the motors within its wheels must be controlled by the Arduino. H-Bridge will be used 
              to control the motors’ speed and direction of rotation which will in turn make it easy to program the robot to go in a straight 
              line, turn right or left or in place, or go backwards. With no sources of power connected to the breadboard, I made the 
              connections between the h‐bridge, motors and the Arduino as shown below.</p>

            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/circuit.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="848.5" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>
            </p>

            <p>To program the motors using the Arduino IDE, I created several new variables: enA (PWM enable signal for motor A), inA1 and inA2 
              (direction control pins for motor A), motorA_SpeedSlwForward (speed for motor A), and another four analogous pins for motor B. I 
              then connected the +4.5 V wire from the AA battery pack to the appropriate pin of the L293D, and the ground wire of the batteries 
              to the common ground. To protect the circuit I also installed two capacitors between the +4.5 V and +5 V sources and the h-bridge, 
              as well as six resistors between the output pins of the Nano and the h-bridge. Fully programmed and functioning motors 
              can be seen below. </p>

          <h3>CALIBRATING THE MOTORS</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Even though the motors are programmed the same, the speeds of the wheels may still not be perfectly identical. To calibrate the 
              wheels, I played with different speeds for motors A and B (motorA_SpeedSlwForward and motorB_SpeedSlwForward) to find the values 
              for which the robot would move in a straight line. I repeated the above procedure for medium speed by creating variables 
              motorA_SpeedMedForward and motorB_SpeedMedForward and finding the appropriate values for those variables. Robot moving in a 
              straight line with slow speed can be seen below.</p>

          <h3>INCORPORATING THE PHOTOSENSORS</h3>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Once the wheels have been calibrated, the robot can now be programmed to perform the required tasks outlined in the objectives section
               above. To do so, I created two new variables: an int expected_environment which was set to 550 and a float NM_threshold which was set 
               to 0.6. The main loop of the code consists of continuous reading of sensor values and calculation of parameters that would determine 
               the actions the robot should take next. The rest of the code is split into five if-statements, one for each possible scenario.</p>

            <p>The first statement checks whether the readings for both the left and right photosensors are lower than the expected_environment variable. 
              This means that the lighting conditions are too dark and uniform for the robot to find a light source. In this case, the robot turns 
              around in place with the onboard LED flashing.</p>

            <p>The next if-statement checks whether either one of the sensors is picking up light that is greater than the expected_environment threshold 
              and whether the normalized left reading is greater than NM_threshold. This means that the robot should turn left to follow the light until 
              the normalized left and right values are roughly equalized. The next if-statement is almost identical to the previous one except for this 
              statement checks whether the normalized right reading is greater than NM_threshold. In this case, the robot would turn right to follow 
              the light.</p>

            <p>The next if-statement would be followed whenever the left and right sensor readings are roughly equal but the photosensors are still 
              picking up light that’s greater than the expected_environment value. This means that a bright light source still exists but the robot 
              is facing it straight on. In this case, the robot goes straight towards the light until it is turned off. The fifth if-statement was 
              just created as good programming practice: in case none of the conditions were somehow satisfied, both of the wheels would shut off 
              and the robot would stop moving completely. Fully programmed robot can be seen below.</p>

            <p>Overall, lab 2 went smoothly with not a lot of challenges along the way. Getting the circuitry correctly was the most time consuming 
              and difficult part, however, after I finished and rechecked the circuit many times, programming the robot wasn’t very hard. </p>

        <h3>LTSpice BASICS AND SIMULATING FILTERS</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <p>In this lab LTSpice will be used to simulate the behavior of filters that will later be implemented in the robot.
            After familiarizing myself with the software, I simulated a low pass filter with a resistor and a capacitor, and graphed 
            the frequency response, zooming-in around the cutoff frequency. Then, switching the components around but keeping the 
            same R and C values I simulated a high pass filter. Frequency responses of both filters can be seen below.</p>

        <h3>BUILDING THE MICROPHONE CIRCUIT</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>In labs 3 and 4, a microphone will be used to collect the sound and Arduino will be used to process this sound on the robot. 
            To build the microphone circuit, I followed the schematic shown in Figure 1.</p>

        <h3>CHARACTERIZING THE CIRCUIT</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>To test and compare the physical implementation of the low pass, high pass, and bandpass filters simulated in Section 1,
            code that will be used by the Nano and code that will be used by MATLAB need to be written. The goal for later labs is for 
            the robot to be able to pick up sounds and discern specific frequencies so that it can act according to those frequencies.
            I wrote Arduino code that allowed the Nano to collect sound from the microphone circuit and print it to the serial 
            port so that it can be read by MATLAB for analysis. A sketch freeRunADC_MATLAB.ino was created to manually code the ADC 
            that it is in Free Running mode. The code also converts read ADC values to a signed 16 bit number, having positive and 
            negative values. This is done by shifting the read values down and scaling them such that a 16 bit number is obtained.</p>

        <h3>CODING IN MATLAB TO FETCH DATA FROM THE ARDUINO</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>To now visualze the sound that had been picked up by the microphone and passed through ADC conversion, MATLAB will be used.
            The code has three major functions: to play a sound of increasing frequency over the speakers, to collect the sound with the Nano 
            and perform the ADC conversion, and to perform Fourier analysis in MATLAB on the data so that it can be analyzed. 
            To calculate the FFT and plot the spectrtum of the acquired signal, an FFT library was used. After playing a sound of frequency
            around 500 Hz for a few seconds, the following plot was obtained.  </p>

        <h3>IMPROVING THE MICROPHONE CIRCUIT</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>As can be observed above, the spectrum’s value at the frequency of ~500 Hz is relatively weak since the microphone is not 
            very good at picking up sound. Using an op-amp and Figure 3 as a reference, I built a circuit to amplify the sound that was 
            picked up by the microphone.</p>

          <p>
            <img src="assets/img/fig3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="848.5" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>

          <p>
            <img src="assets/img/circuit3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="848.5" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>
          </p>

          <p>With the circuit implemented, I executed the MATLAB code to get the plot of the frequency spectrum. A much larger peak near 
            the ~500Hz signal frequency can be seen due to the amplification.</p>
          <p>

        <h3>TESTING THE LOW PASS AND HIGH PASS CIRCUITS</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>To test the passive low pass and high pass filters simulated in Section 1, I built the low-pass filter on the breadboard using the 
            provided components. The output of the amplified microphone circuit was connected to the input of the low pass filter so 
            that theoretically only certain sound frequncies would be able to pass through. To obtain the system’s frequency response 𝐻(Ω), 
            I measured the signal coming out of the low pass filter 𝑌(Ω) and divided it by the system’s measured input signal’s spectrum 𝑋(Ω).
            The process was repeated to obtain the frequency response of the high-pass filter.</p>

            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/low-pass-measured.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="848.5" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>
            </p>

            <p>As can be seen from both plots, the measured frequency responses were very far from the theoretical values. This can most likely 
              be attributed to the poor quality of circuit components or to noise from the jump wires.</p>

            <p>
              <img src="assets/img/high-pass-measured.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="848.5" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>

        <p><br/></p>

        <h3>BUILIDNG THE BANDPASS FILTER</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>The point of filtering the audio signal picked up by the Arduino is to eliminate noise and interference. Eventually the robot will 
            be programmed to only respond to specific audio signals which means that a filter is needed to eliminate undesirable audio noise
            outside of our audio range of interest. Following a similar procedure to the one described in the previous section, I built a bandpass
            filter and obtained the plot of its frequency response by first measuring the output of the filter 𝑌(Ω) and then dividing it by the
            input 𝑋(Ω).</p>

          <p>
            <img src="assets/img/band-pass-measured.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" width="600" height="848.5" style="border-radius: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;"/>
          </p>

          <p>The frequency response of the bandpass filter is still not very close to the theoretical response, however, the general shape was
            similar to what would be needed to filter out noise. The plot clearly shows that for some range of frequencies (approximately 700 to 1200 Hz), 
            the signal was able to pass through, while for all other frequencies it was attenuated.</p>

        <h3>FFT ON ARDUINO</h3>
        <div class="row">

          <p>But for your robot, MATLAB will not be used to perform Fourier analysis: it must be performed on the Arduino. While the Nano’s capabilities are not as powerful as your computer’s, it still can perform Fourier analysis. For this, you will use a library.
            The Nano will accumulate ADC sampled values (257 such values: you will acquire 257 samples but will ignore the first value and the remaining 256 will be used for calculations
            The 256 sampled values will be manipulated to convert them from a value between 0 and 1023 that the Nano provides to a signed integer with negative and positive values
            The rescaled 256 sampled values will be processed by the FFT library on the Nano by invoking a series of commands from the library resulting in an FFT spectrum in 256 bins
            For testing and characterization purposes, you can print the resulting 128 bins to the Serial Monitor and plot the result to visualize the spectrum obtained by the Nano
            Then, based on what will be in the spectrum that the Nano will calculate, your robot (in Lab 4) will make a decision as to what to do.
